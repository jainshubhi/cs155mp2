We implemented matrix factorization using the Alternating Least Squares algorithm.
The number of latent factors we used was 20 (as specified in the project description),
and our value of lambda was [******] because [******]. Our stopping criterion was based
on the change in U from step to step. As it got closer to 0, we stopped.
Our equations for each step of U and V were as follows:
[******]
We implemented this in Matlab. With the resulting U and V vectors we applied Matlab's
built in SVD function and chose the first two columns of the result to get the best
projection of our model to two dimensions. Then, we plotted interesting results of our
model that we found.

We would expect movies from the same series to be similar, and therefore have similar
weights in our model. So, we plot the values of V for a few series:
[******]

We also want to check that our projection from 20 dimensions to 2 dimensions did not
lose too much information. So, we plot the change in rating from predicting with all
20 dimensions to predicting with just 2 dimensions to make sure the deltas are not
too large:
[******]

Now, we would like to see if the dimensions mean something that we can interpret. So,
we plot the means of each genre:
[******]

The genres are labeled as follows:
1 : unknown
2 : Action
3 : Adventure
4 : Animation
5 : Childrenâ€™s
6 : Comedy
7 : Crime
8 : Documentary
9 : Drama
10: Fantasy
11: Film-Noir
12: Horror
13: Musical
14: Mystery
15: Romance
16: Sci-Fi
17: Thriller
18: War
19: Western

So, we see that these two dimensions can be interpreted as having some meaning.
